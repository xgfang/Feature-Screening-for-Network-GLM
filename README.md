# Feature-Screening-for-Network-GLM
This repository was created for Joint Feature Screening Incorporating Network Structure Among Responses.

DataGenerator.R: R code for data generation.

data_generator.cpp: An accelerated version of the data generation code using Rcpp.

Algorithm.R: Main algorithm for the feature screening.

Linear, Logistic, Poisson.R: Simulations conducted on these exponential families.

eigenvalues.cpp and mvrnorm.cpp: Subfunctions accelerated using Rcpp.
